# Triangle Ghost Theme #

The Triangle Ghost theme is built as a solid foundation for any project. This theme can serve as a starting point for advanced web developers, while also providing a clean design for those who prefer to grow their style organically over time. We have released this theme under Creative Commons license and only ask that you retain the links to Ghost and Haeck Design for our efforts. We cannot supply support with this theme (being that it is free and we all have bills), but please feel free to submit any bugs and we will take them in to consideration on future revisions.
